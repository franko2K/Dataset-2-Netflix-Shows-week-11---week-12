## Dataset 2: Netflix Shows DATABASES

The data is too large since the movies are very many so its tedious to know exactly what you want and where you would want to place it or to get an exact movie that you would like.
The interesting thing is that the movies have added dates, ratings, types, and ID's which we can use with database filter functions to get the exact data we need.
