CREATE database Cinema;

2. Data FUN

SELECT * FROM Netflix
WHERE Country='Mexico';

SELECT * FROM Netflix
WHERE listed_in = 'Thrillers';

SELECT * FROM Netflix
WHERE description LIKE '%romance%';

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Netflix;

SELECT COUNT(type)
FROM Netflix
WHERE director = 'Steven Spielberg';

SELECT AVG(country)
FROM Netflix
WHERE type = 'Movie';

3. Ask Away
Which movies from the database has Spike Lee directed?

How many TV shows are there compared to Movies in the database?

SELECT * FROM Netflix
WHERE director = 'Steven Spielberg';

SELECT COUNT(type)
FROM Netflix
WHERE type = 'Movie';

SELECT COUNT(type)
FROM Netflix
WHERE type = 'TV Show';

Data can be easily calculated using SQL queries depending on what is required like number of movies released in a certain year.
